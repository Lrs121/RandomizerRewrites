This character tracker was created for The Lunarian Shuffle by HungryTenor.  Thanks!

To use it, download then open it with any web browser.
Click a small character, then the corresponding slot to show where the character went!

For those more technically inclined, there are some more advanced settings, too.
Open the file in a text editor for more details.

Enjoy,
- Crow!
